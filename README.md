Welcome to Pacman!

As a way to gain experience with java swing, I developed my own version of the Pacman videogame. So far it only has 2 levels, I might code more if someday I have spare time...

HOW TO RUN THE APP:

From the maven projectâ€™s root folder, run the following commands:

- To generate the jar file (the first time):
  mvn install
- To play:
  mvn exec:java

Enjoy!
